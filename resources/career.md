If you find yourself enjoying coding, you can start looking into summer internships + careers in CS!

## Personal Website

I made a [tutorial](/resources/personal-site.html) on how to create a personal website like this!

## Networking

I recommend joining [handshake](https://joinhandshake.com/) and keeping an eye on the [computer science department events](https://cs.unc.edu/events/)! (Also look at the Handshake 'Events' section for general UNC career resources!)

If you find yourself enjoying coding, you can start looking into summer internships + careers in CS!

## Personal Website

I made a [tutorial](/resources/personal-site.html) on how to create a personal website like this!

## Networking

I recommend joining [handshake](https://joinhandshake.com/) and keeping an eye on the [computer science department events](https://cs.unc.edu/events/)! (Also look at the Handshake 'Events' section for general UNC career resources!)

You also can find a list of 2024 internships [here](https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2024-Internships).

## Practice 

[neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) provides a roadmap for practicing Technical Interview questions!
